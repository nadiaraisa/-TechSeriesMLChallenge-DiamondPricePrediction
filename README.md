# Diamond Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Diamond Price Prediction project, an exciting challenge undertaken as part of the GDSC UB #TechSeriesMLChallenge. This repository showcases our journey in developing a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on various features.

## Challenge Overview:
The #TechSeriesMLChallenge, hosted by GDSC UB, provided us with the opportunity to delve into the world of machine learning and tackle a real-world problem. Our focus was on predicting diamond prices, a task that requires understanding and analyzing diverse factors influencing the market value of these precious gemstones.

## Project Highlights:
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** We meticulously explored and preprocessed the dataset to ensure accurate and reliable predictions. This involved handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
  
- **Feature Engineering:** To enhance the predictive power of our model, we crafted new features and engineered existing ones. This step played a crucial role in capturing nuanced relationships within the data.

- **Model Selection and Training:** Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we experimented with various models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting. Our goal was to identify the most effective model for diamond price prediction.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model hyperparameters was a key aspect of our project. Through rigorous experimentation, we optimized our models to achieve the best possible performance.

- **Evaluation and Metrics:** We employed industry-standard metrics to evaluate the performance of our models, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their strengths and limitations. Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared were among the metrics considered.

## Challenges Faced:
The journey was not without its challenges. From handling outliers to selecting the most suitable features, we encountered and overcame obstacles that enriched our learning experience.

## Acknowledgments:
We extend our gratitude to GDSC UB for organizing the #TechSeriesMLChallenge, providing a platform for us to apply our machine learning skills to a real-world problem.
